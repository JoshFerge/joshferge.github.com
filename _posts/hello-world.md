- In the ongoing shift to renewables battery storage is a hot topic due to the duck curve of solar and intermittency of wind.
- Lithium ion has conquered the battery storage market in principle due to its learning curve, scaling for EVs.
- Thus far they have been utilized through grid level mega battery projects, and at home batteries, like the tesla power wall.
- Find how much storage we currently need to handle peaks of solar -- talk about how we'll very soon be in a world where california is curtailing much of its solar output in the summer daytime.
- Powerwalls in a lot of places are not profitable and only make sense if you also find value in the emergency backup situation
- Grid level mega battery projects are coming online, but not quickly enough
- A large fraction of batteries (what %) are going to electric vehicles. 95% of the time, electric vehicles are parked.
- Vehicle to grid is the storage strategy of using a car's battery to power the home / sell to the grid during peak load hours, while taking advantage of cheaper charging during off load hours.
- How valuable would this be?
- -- Tesla planning to include it
- Ford already includes it to the car -- how much extra?
- What is potential ROI? What regulatory problems may be encountered? Battery health? Efficiency?
- Total GwH of car battery storage. what % realistically could be used for this
- What happens at saturation -- how do cars charge? what is the charging pattern?
