	Michelle Ferguson (http://polsci.colorado.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/michaele-ferguson)
			Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. Ph.D. Harvard University, 2003 
		Professor Ferguson is currently working on a book manuscript entitled Sharing Democracy. This book critically examines a dominant presumption in democratic theory that democracies can only work where citizens share something in common – whether that is a nationality, a set of political values, or the status of citizenship. In place of this presumption, Ferguson develops a nonfoundationalist account of how we share democracy with others. This project has been supported by a Visiting Research Fellowship at the University of Utah’s Tanner Humanities Center	and a Junior Faculty Development Award from CU. 
		Her work has appeared in Hypatia, Theory & Event, The European Legacy, and Philosophy in Review. 
			Together with Professors Vanessa Baird and David Mapel, she is the recipient of a Ford Foundations Difficult Dialogues Initiative stipend http://www.difficultdialogues.org/projects/and a grant from CU’s Institute for Civic and Ethical Engagement to fund the development of a new service-learning course focused on the cultivation of the dialogue skills necessary for effective citizenship in diverse societies.
