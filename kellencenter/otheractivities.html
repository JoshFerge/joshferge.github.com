			<h4>Keller Center Fellows</h4>
			The Keller Center has occasionally offered fellowship opportunities to visiting scholars interested in the study of the first amendment. 
			</p>
			<p>
			2011-2012: Frank J. Colucci (http://webs.purduecal.edu/histpoly/department-of-history-and-political-science/faculty/frank-colucci/), Perdue University Calumet
		</p>
		<p>
Frank J. Colucci is a visiting assistant professor of political science and a fellow at the Keller Center for the 2011-2012 academic year. He is associate professor of political science at Purdue University Calumet, just east of Chicago. 
</p>
<p>
Frank's main research interests involve constitutional theory and the U.S. Supreme Court. His book Justice Kennedy's Jurisprudence: The Full and Necessary Meaning of Liberty (University Press of Kansas, 2009) examines the constitutional and judicial vision held by the Court's pivotal justice. While at the Keller Center he will teach courses on the First Amendment and in political theory as well as continue work on his second book--a study of the background, decision and aftermath of the school prayer case Lee v. Weisman (1992). 
</p>
Frank received his B.A. in political science and magazine journalism from Syracuse University and his M.A. and Ph.D. in political science from the University of Notre Dame. He is a native of Rhode Island and a die-hard Boston Red Sox fan. 
<p>
Spring 2011: David Leitch (https://sites.google.com/site/davidgleitch/Home)
</p>
<p>
David Leitch (BA Oberlin 2000, PhD UCSD 2008) is the Keller Center Fellow for 2011. 
</p>
<p>
His dissertation, "The Politics of Understanding: Language as a Model of Culture," investigated the limits of religious toleration in American society, focusing on the Amish and public education. His primary research agenda engages in articulating new ways of thinking about political engagement across deep cultural divisions in liberal polities, and the conceptual promise of analogizing cultures with languages. An article on different models of encountering other cultures in Mark Twain's writing has appeared in the October 2010 issue of Polity, and an article on Lev Vygotsky and Mikhail Bakhtin is forthcoming in Mind, Culture, and Activity. 
</p>
<p>
He is currently finishing two papers on Bakhtin, one on Bakhtin's contribution to debates over legal interpretation, and the other on Charles Taylor's reliance on Bakhtin in formulating recognition and the dialogical self.

	<h4>Ford Foundation Grant</h4>

	<p>
	The Keller Center is proud to announce that it has been awarded a $10,000 Ford Foundation Grant for its proposal, "Difficult Dialogues." Below is a short version of our proposal, together with a link to Prof. Vanessa Baird's first pilot version of this course, which will eventually be team-taught with Prof. Michaele Ferguson.
</p>
<h4>
Proposal: Difficult Dialogues 
Project Leaders: Vanessa Baird, Michaele Ferguson, David Mapel
</h4>
<p>
If one had to pick a university in the U.S. where controversy has raged about religious, cultural and political diversity and its relation to academic freedom, it might very well be the University of Colorado, Boulder (CU). In the last year, there has been conflict on campus about abortion and gay rights, incidents involving racist graffiti, charges that one Instructor has been dropped because of left-wing activism and another because of right-wing Christianity, calls from the outside for an “academic bill of rights” and for the reform or abolition of tenure, and of course a veritable firestorm of criticism directed at Prof. Ward Churchill for politically subversive speech and alleged academic misconduct.
</p>
<p>
All of this represents a more general problem that we seek to address, namely, the failure of the academy to educate everyone involved—students, faculty, and the general public--about the rights and duties of academic freedom, and, more broadly, the role of diversity and disagreement in education. On the one hand, universities are commonly seen as rejecting ethical and especially religious pluralism when it comes to empirical subjects, particularly with respect to the teaching of evolution, but also and more subtly with regard to other bio-medical issues, such as stem cell research. On the other hand, universities are also commonly seen as endorsing pluralism in normative matters, especially morality, religion and politics. Some critics charge that this endorsement of pluralism causes students to become relativists who disengage from debate and disagreement. Other critics charge that this endorsement of pluralism is a sham, hiding an essentially liberal consensus on values. We believe that all of these perceptions are symptomatic of the failure of universities to communicate to their students and to the public the role of pluralism in university life, teaching and research. 
</p>
<p>
Thus, we propose a course that we believe will create long-lasting effects on the University of Colorado campus, well after the term of the grant has ended. This course will be administered by the faculty of the Keller Center for the Study of the First Amendment (Profs. Baird, Ferguson, and Mapel), which is housed in the CU Political Science Department. 
</p>
<p>
We propose to focus on four themes of particular relevance to the CU community, but also to the larger U.S. debate:
<ul>
<li>The role of religion in public discourse</li>
<li>Affirmative action in university admissions</li>
<li>Free speech, hate speech, and academic freedom on university campuses</li>
<li>Pluralism and academic freedom in particular disciplines, including the sciences</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The scholarly literature on what causes people to become more tolerant guides all aspects of this proposal. The most important sources of political tolerance are discussions and social networks among diverse groups, and opportunities for those groups to be active in community service. For this reason, our proposal contains elements of these two kinds of activities, both in the course and in events involving the larger university and general community. Peffley and Rohrschneider (2003) and Cigler and Joslyn (2002) find that the most important determinant of democratic learning is democratic action. In other words, when people exercise their civil liberties and rights, they are more likely to support civil liberties and civil rights for others, even for those that they might consider to be their political enemies. According to this logic, having students, faculty, staff, and members of the larger community actively participating will create networks across different kinds of groups on campus, both in and outside of classes, and therefore inspire greater tolerance (Golebiowska 1995, Mutz 2002 and Alba 1978). 
</p>

<h4>Team-Taught Undergraduate Course on "Difficult Dialogues"</h4>
<p>
We will develop an undergraduate course (100 students) to be team-taught by two faculty: one who approaches these topics primarily from a humanistic perspective, the other from a social scientific approach. This course will examine (a) the normative justifications for valuing moral, political and religious pluralism, (b) the justification and limits of pluralism in American jurisprudence, (c) the political psychology of pluralism (e.g. what causes people to hate or tolerate one another), and (d) how these first three questions are specifically related to the four topics listed above. 
</p>
<p>
Students will do more than just learn this material, however; they will engage in active learning (Bonwell and Eison 1991) through one of two course projects. First, they can opt to pursue research into what causes support for tolerance and diversity at CU. With our guidance, they will use the academic literature to design their own experimental research to further our understanding of the determinants of tolerant attitudes. This project enlists students as producers of knowledge about pluralism. Second, they can opt to pursue service learning by finding ways to generate dialogue between diverse groups in the CU or Denver/Boulder community; this project gives students experience with encountering, learning about, and tolerating those who differ from them. We will encourage students to find service opportunities through CU's Volunteer Clearinghouse. Current research on active learning (Bean 1996, Eyler and Giles 1999) shows that critical reflection on how such course projects inform, converge with, or diverge from studied material contributes to longer-lasting, more profound learning. Thus students will keep a weekly critical reflection journal.

<h4>Book of Interest</h4>
<p>
Deliberation, Democracy, and the Media was born of the first Keller Center conference in 1999 -- "Media and Democratic Discourse" -- which invited respected scholars from diverse disciplines to examine how conflicts are communicated, debated, and sometimes even resolved in the public sphere under the intense light of a free press.
</p>
<p>
The book organizes the collected scholarship from that conference into themed chapters.
</p>
<p>
Deliberation, Democracy, and the Media
Is deliberative democracy the ideal goal of free speech? How do social movement organizations, activists, and political candidates use the media to frame their discourse? What responsibilities does the media have in maintaining or promoting democracy?
</p>
<p>
In this broadly interdisciplinary volume, top scholars in communication, political science, sociology, law, and philosophy offer new perspectives on these and other intersections within democratic discourse and media.
</p>
<p>
Interweaving elements of social, political, and communication theory, they take on First Amendment and legal issues, privacy rights, media effects and agenda setting, publicity, multiculturalism, gender issues, universalism and global culture, and the rhetoric of the body, among other topics. This unique book provides a foundation for evaluating the current state of democratic discourse and will be of interest to students and scholars of deliberative democracy across the social sciences.
