				<h3>Bio</h3>
				<p>I was born in Denver, Colorado and went to Englewood High School. I currently attend the University of Colorado in Boulder. I am majoring in Computer Science and I have been programming for about six years now. My favorite language to program in is Python. I also love front end web development. Besides messing around with computers, I like to go outside for a bike ride or rip up the mountains on my snowboard.
				</p>
				<h3>Work</h3>
				<p>First starting working at 10 years old as dishwasher at my Dad's restaurant. I think that infused the habit of tireless work ethic in me at a young age. In my younger years I also created a youtube channel, which has since generated almost half a million views. Since my humble beginnings, I have interned for Creative Learning Systems, a small business that focuses on creating 21st Century Learning Environments. I have also worked for ASSETT, CU's campus web development department. There I designed and implemented CMS based website for departments to use and update. I also participated in Startup Colorado's Startup Summer internship program, where I interned with a local startup as well as attended night seminars featuring notable members of Boulder's startup community.
				<h3>The Future</h3>
				<p>For next summer my goal is to intern with Google, Apple, or any other already-successful tech company. If you have any contacts, or are a contact, at a big tech company please shoot me an email or tweet. I'd love to get in touch.
