					<ul style="float:left;">
						<li >Born March 14th, 1879</li>
						<li>Moved around a lot in childhood</li>
						<li>Attended Polytechnic Institute<br> in Switzerland</li>
						<li>Renounced Citizenship<br>in Germany</li>

					<aside class="notes">
						Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard).

						<h2><em>Annus mirabilis</em> (Year of Wonders)</h2>
						<p>Wrote four groundbreaking articles in the year of 1905</p>

						<h2>Photoelectric effect</h2>
						<p>"Energy, during the propagation of a ray of light, is not continuously distributed over steadily increasing spaces, but it consists of a finite number of energy quanta localised at points in space, moving without dividing and capable of being absorbed or generated only as entities."</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Brownian motion</h2>
						<p>Bodies of a microscopically visible size suspended in liquids must, as a result of thermal molecular motions, perform motions of such magnitudes that they can be easily observed with a microscope. It is possible that the motions to be discussed here are identical with so-called Brownian molecular motion.</p>
						
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Special relativity</h2>
						<p>He applies the principle of relativity, which states that the laws of physics remain the same for any non-accelerating frame of reference (called an inertial reference frame), to the laws of electrodynamics and optics as well as mechanics. In the second postulate, Einstein proposes that the speed of light has the same value in all inertial frames of reference, independent of the state of motion of the emitting body./p>

					<h2>Quotes</h2>
					
					<blockquote>
						He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would fully suffice.
					</blockquote>

				<section>

				<blockquote>
					If A is a success in life, then A equals X plus Y plus Z. Work is X; Y is play; and Z is keeping your mouth shut.

						The most powerful force in the universe is compound interest.

					<blockquote>
					The finest emotion of which we are capable is the mystic emotion. Herein lies the germ of all art and all true science. Anyone to whom this feeling is alien, who is no longer capable of wonderment and lives in a state of fear is a dead man. To know that what is impenatrable for us really exists and manifests itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, whose gross forms alone are intelligible to our poor faculties - this knowledge, this feeling that is the core of the true religious sentiment. In this sense, and in this sense alone, I rank myself amoung profoundly religious men.
